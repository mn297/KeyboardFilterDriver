# KeyboardFilterDriver

A keyboard filter driver that logs keystroke. It is based on an outdated but informational post by Vijay Mukhi a while ago. This project attempts to recreate the driver with Visual Studio 2022 and test it in a Windows 10 system.

The blog post is edited and the code beautified [here](https://github.com/mn297/KeyboardFilterDriver/blob/main/VijayMukhiBlogPost.md)
